    ":::info Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Chat Models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models)\n",
    "- [Chaining runnables](/docs/how_to/sequence/)\n",
    "- [Embeddings](/docs/concepts/#embedding-models)\n",
    "- [Vector stores](/docs/concepts/#vector-stores)\n",
    "- [Retrieval-augmented generation](/docs/tutorials/rag/)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "The popularity of projects like [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), and [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) underscore the importance of running LLMs locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain has integrations with [many open-source LLM providers](/docs/how_to/local_llms) that can be run locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will show how to run `LLaMA 3.1` via one provider, [Ollama](/docs/integrations/providers/ollama/) locally (e.g., on your laptop) using local embeddings and a local LLM. However, you can set up and swap in other local providers, such as [LlamaCPP](/docs/integrations/chat/llamacpp/) if you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This guide uses a [chat model](/docs/concepts/#chat-models) wrapper that takes care of formatting your input prompt for the specific local model you're using. However, if you are prompting local models directly with a [text-in/text-out LLM](/docs/concepts/#llms) wrapper, you may need to use a prompt tailed for your specific model. This will often [require the inclusion of special tokens](https://huggingface.co/blog/llama2#how-to-prompt-llama-2). [Here's an example for LLaMA 2](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/rlm/rag-prompt-llama).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll need to set up Ollama.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructions [on their GitHub repo](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) provide details, which we summarize here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Download](https://ollama.com/download) and run their desktop app\n",
    "- From command line, fetch models from [this list of options](https://ollama.com/library). For this guide, you'll need:\n",
    "  - A general purpose model like `llama3.1:8b`, which you can pull with something like `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`\n",
    "  - A [text embedding model](https://ollama.com/search?c=embedding) like `nomic-embed-text`, which you can pull with something like `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`\n",
    "- When the app is running, all models are automatically served on `localhost:11434`\n",
    "- Note that your model choice will depend on your hardware capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, install packages needed for local embeddings, vector storage, and inference."
